# COVID-STATS

This is Open Source data about COVID-19 cases in Kosovo. The scripts used in this program should be run as follows:
`ipython covid.py`

If you would like to run it using the invoke system, the following command will kick off the process:
`invoke build push --tag release`

***I have removed all of the MacOS specific code. This should work on any computer now. On Windows, I would highly recomoend using Scientific Python instead of trying to roll your own.***


# Just the Facts

If you would just like to see the results of the scripts, I make a [release](https://github.com/bnice5000/COVID-STATS/releases) almost every weekday.

# Note about the data

We have been entering the data daily. At some point before 2020-05-19 the data was retrospectively modified. It an effort to maintain transparency, we have the old data file, the new data file, along with a diff file of the changes. If the data diverges again we will use the same process to maintain transparency.
